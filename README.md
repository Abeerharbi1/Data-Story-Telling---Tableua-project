# Data-Story-Telling---Tableua-project
At this project we aim to tell a story using visualizations to explore the performance of baseball players. The analysis is done using Tableau. The dataset which provided to us from Udacity, had 1,157 baseball players, along with their handedness, batting average, homeruns, height and weight.
